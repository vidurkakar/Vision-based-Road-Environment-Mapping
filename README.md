# Vision-based-Road-Environment-Mapping

### Problem Statement-
Road environment mapping is a very relevant problem for autonomous driving systems.
Recognizing lanes and detecting vehicles in the surrounding environment to avoid collisions 
are the main challenges faced by these systems. In this project we aim at using dash-cam footage to discern lanes 
to create a lane departure warning system for vehicles. We have also implemented vehicle detection.
